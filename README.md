# Investigate_a_dataset
In this project, I analyzed a dataset about IMDb movies on Kaggle and then communicate my findings about it. 
You made use of Python libraries including NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

Please take a look at the dataset in a separate file.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
